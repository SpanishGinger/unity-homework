The founder is a cartoon simulator of starting a business. The game is easy to get invested in but also challenging in being 
succesful in your fictional business. Much like in real life you start out from nothing but initial designs and cocepts that 
are limited in quality and quantity based on your initial budget and employee count. Over time you will hire employees to 
contribute their effort as you r business slowly grows. One big challenge is the competion with other business to compete for 
market share with the limited quantity of products you will have to sell. The graphics are low poly and simplistec in aestetic, 
however, some textures are too low quality compared to the 3D models.
